## Reflection

![Design preview for the Huddle landing page with alternating feature blocks coding challenge](src/assets/images/DesignSpec.png)

- The challenge is to build out the project to the designs specifications.

- The designs are in JPG static format. This means one's own best judgment was used for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. The goal to exercise training one's eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.

- A different navigation menu and logo have been implemented to add another aspect to the coding and design challenge.
